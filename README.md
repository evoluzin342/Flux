# Flux
 
  Flux is an architectural pattern based on unidirectional data flow.
 
# Core Concepts
  
- [Store]- manage business data and state

- [View] - a hierarchical composition of React components

- [Actions] -events created from user events that triggered on the View
 
- [Dispatcher] - an event bus for all actions
